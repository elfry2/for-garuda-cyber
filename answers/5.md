MVC is an abbreviation of Model-View-Controller. It's a software design pattern that divides the application architecture into at least the three type of component already stated in its name: model, view, and controller. Their roles are basically as follows:

- A model normally represents, although not necessarily, a table in the database. It serves as an object-oriented wrapper to the table, thanks to which we are able to interact with it the same way we interact with any other object, instead of via long SQL queries in the code

- A view is basically the UI, or rather a template of it. It's what users will see and interact with. Which view is returned to the users and what data it presents is up to the controller; the view itself is simply there to render the given data and it mustn't do more; certainly not querying the database

- A controller is commonly thought of as the "glue" between models and views. At some part it returns an appropriate view and at another it validates user inputs and interacts with the database via models

They're usually accompanied by a "router", which decides which controller handles which request. It allows us also to specify what set of middlewares get run every time a certain kind of request is received.
